# SwagLabsAutomation
Automation project for https://www.saucedemo.com

There are some login tests and two e2e tests. They can be found in the Test classes.
What they cover:
- the core business flow: placing a product in the cart and performing checkout with it
- products are added to the cart from the Products and Product details page
- the sums are verified for mathematically correctness, a tax is also present

The application is mapped with: ID, className and xpath. This was also the preferred choice of locating the webelements.

Random product(s) (are) is selected at each run.
